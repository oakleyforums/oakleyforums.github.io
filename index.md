## Welcome to Oakley Forums

Long ago this website actually contained a forum to discuss Oakley Sunglasses. These days though, it sits.

Perhaps you want to purchase some Oakley Sunglasses? You can do that using the links below, they all come from my personal collection:

[Oakley Thump Pro 1GB](https://www.ebay.com/itm/155402175662) These are a pair of glasses with the original box and I believe all materials and products that come in the box. They are essentially brand new, I did plug them in and charge them to make sure that they work.
